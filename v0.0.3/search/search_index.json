At the time, I had no programming experience, but after starting my studies at Algonquin College, I realized I could actually bring this idea to life. Over the next few weeks, I learned the necessary skills and built the bot, making several iterations to get it working. As I gained more confidence, the project evolved beyond its original scope, eventually becoming a bot that allows users to control the PC it\u2019s hosted on directly through Discord chat. While this was one of my first personal projects and the code may not be perfect, it was an invaluable learning experience, and I\u2019m still proud of how much I accomplished and how much I learned through the process.</p>"},{"location":"projects/software/projects/#recipe-website","title":"Recipe Website","text":"<p>Source code is found here.</p> <p>I\u2019m currently working on a recipe website for a friend that will serve as a digital space to store and organize all of her favorite recipes.

With features like customizable recipe cards, ingredient lists, and cooking instructions, this website will help her keep track of her culinary creations and share them effortlessly. This project has also given me the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of AWS, exploring services like S3 for storage and Lambda functions for serverless automation, enhancing both the functionality and scalability of the website. It\u2019s a project that combines both functionality and personal touch, tailored to fit her unique cooking style.</p>"}]}
