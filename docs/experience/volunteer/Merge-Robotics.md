# Merge Robotics

Merge Robotics Website is found [here](https://www.team2706.ca/).

I joined Merge Robotics as a mentor two years ago, and since then, I have served as both a business and software mentor for multiple groups of high school students on our team. Merge Robotics is a [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) Robotics League team, and each year, we design and build a robot to compete in the new game released globally. In addition to our technical work, we engage in community outreach, offering small tech lessons to kids, organizing neighborhood cleanups, volunteering at events hosted by our sponsors, and more. Through these activities, I have helped support both the development of the students and the improvement of our local community.
