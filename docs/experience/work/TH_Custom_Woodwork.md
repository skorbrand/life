### Custom Furniture Woodworker

At TH Custom Woodwork, I crafted high-quality custom furniture, including tables, cabinets, and shelving, tailored to client specifications. I installed pieces with precision, ensuring a seamless fit and proper functionality within clients' spaces. By communicating effectively to understand design needs, I built strong client relationships and provided exceptional customer service. Additionally, I enhanced my problem-solving skills by addressing on-site challenges and adapting designs to meet unique spatial requirements.
