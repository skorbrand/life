### Forklift operator & Cashier

At Costco, I worked in the front-end as a cashier/packer and in the parking lot, as well as an AM Merchandiser, delivering exceptional customer service and ensuring operational efficiency. In my front-end role, I handled transactions, packed purchases, maintained a positive checkout experience, and worked in the parking lot, collecting and sanitizing shopping carts. As an AM Merchandiser, I restocked shelves, organized inventory, operated forklifts, and maintained stock levels throughout the morning and afternoon. These roles helped me develop multitasking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills in a fast-paced environment.
