### Merchandiser

As a Merchandiser at The Brick, I served as the final point of contact for customers, ensuring a positive last impression through personalized interactions. I maintained a high-volume warehouse, developing strong organizational skills and attention to detail. Additionally, I designed and assembled visually appealing front displays to attract customer interest and promote featured products, contributing to a dynamic and engaging shopping experience.
