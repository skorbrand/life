## About Me

I am a results-oriented professional with an interest in robotics and software development. Currently, I work at TH Custom Woodwork, where I apply my skills in crafting custom furniture and providing top-notch service. I completed the Computer Programming diploma at Algonquin College, where I developed a strong foundation in coding, problem-solving, and application development. Through my work experiences and Algonquin College, Iâ€™ve become proficient at working both independently and in teams in various work environments. In my free time, I like to spend time with my friends, both real life and online, work on programming projects, and continue learning new programming concepts
